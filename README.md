# app_store

üßø The datasets contain some info and descriptions about apps on the App Store.

üëÄ I have used from basic to some advanced SQL queries (including Window Function) for the analysis.

‚ú® Explore the data and provide useful insights to the stakeholder (maybe for an indie App Developer)

### Summary for Final Recommendations 

- Can choose in top 3 genres by the number of apps ['Games'], ['Entertainment'], and ['Education']
   
- At the same time to prevent a highly competitive market in those genres
   Select between ['Business'], ['Reference'], ['Weather'], or ['Shopping'] 
   with a much lesser number of apps and an average rating of >= 3.5


- ['Productivity'] and ['Music'] genres have the highest average user rating of 4
    and a moderate number of apps


- Paid apps have got better overall average ratings than Free apps. 
   Also, most of the genres have higher average user ratings for paid apps 
   including ['Games'] and ['Entertainment'] 


- Large-size apps (> 200 MB) are likely to get better user ratings.


- Apps that support languages around 10 to 30 get good user ratings on average.


- Apps with a longer description tend to get better ratings. Maybe, a longer description helps users get 
   a good overview of the app.

ü§ù I hope you find this useful. Also, you can contribute to the project by suggesting any changes or add-ons in the queries if possible.

#### Thank You!
